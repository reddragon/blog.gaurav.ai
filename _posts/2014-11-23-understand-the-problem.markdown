This is my first post on this blog, which doesn't discuss any specific problem / technology. As I have been spending time writing code, I feel that it is a good practice to sit back and introspect once in a while. This post has some thoughts, which I hope will make people sit up and notice if they are making the same mistakes. Because this is a long-ish post, some might not read it completely, or some might not be able to relate to the content right now. Regardless, I feel eventually a significant number of us will make the mistakes that I have made in the past, and learn from it first hand. Whatever the case may be, if this makes any sense to you, please share your thoughts and experiences with me :)

As Engineers I feel we are often excited to work on new and ambitious projects. I am specifically talking about non-trivial projects which break new ground, and/or have a reasonable change of not succeeding. The latter could be because it is often the case that, these projects are complicated enough and its hard to be exact with respect to the benefits. These projects might also touch certain areas of the system which are hazy in general.

'Hazy' doesn't really imply that that particular area / part of the system, is naturally hard to understand. It could be just that we don't know the problem well enough, and how it interacts with those 'hazy' areas. I cannot stress enough that it is critical to understand the problem really well before hand. It seems clich√©d, and has been repeated so many times, that it will probably not make a good enough impact. So, I will repeat this again in detail, so it stays with you and me, a little longer.

## Understand The Problem

As per Prof. Bender, when giving a presentation, making sure that people understand why we did what we did, is the most important thing. Extending this backwards, ever wondered if that problem _really_ needs to be solved in the first place? A lot of times, as a new CS graduate, working on my first full-time unsupervised big tasks, I would really be in awe of the supposed problem. Looking with rose-tinted glasses, you feel that this is what you had told the recruiter and interviewers that you wanted to do in the job. Excellent, lets start working on it. And if you do this, and just jump into this directly, you are going to have a bad time.

Often I did not spend enough time understanding why exactly was I doing what I was doing. Do benchmarks show that this is really needed? Do I have a good enough prototype which shows that if I do what I am going to do, it will give us significant benefits? Do people need this? Has this problem been solved before? What is the minimum I can do to solve this reasonably, and move on to other bigger problems?

This proactive research is what I feel is the difference between new and experienced engineers. In fact, I think, in some cases senior engineers write LESS code than the less experienced ones and still get more things done. Its now clear to me, that the actual coding should only take 10% of the time allocated to the project. If I spend enough time doing my due-diligence and am 'lazy', I can simply prune some potential duds much before they turn into huge time sinks. If I spend some more time on the problems which actually require my time, I can figure out things I can do to reduce the scope of the problem, or cleverly use pre-built solutions to do part/most of the work. All this can only come if we (and I will repeat again) Understand. The. Problem.
