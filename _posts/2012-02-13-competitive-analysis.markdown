Professor Bender mentioned this thing called 'Competitive Analysis' in class.

It is basically analysing the performance of your algorithm in difficult scenarios, with the optimal performance in easier scenarios. For example, it is easier to do Off-line scheduling than On-line scheduling. One could compare how bad one's algorithm performs in the on-line version, by looking at its performance relative to the optimal / good schedule in the off-line case.
