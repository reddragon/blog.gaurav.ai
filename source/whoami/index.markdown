I am an engineer living in Silicon Valley. Before this, I was toiling hard as a grad student at [Stony Brook University](http://cs.stonybrook.edu).

Checkout some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/reddragon), or follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gawruff). For anything formal, see my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/gauravmenghani) profile.
