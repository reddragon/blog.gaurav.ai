Hi! I am an engineer living somewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area, USA. Before this, I was toiling hard as a grad student at [Stony Brook University](http://cs.stonybrook.edu), hunting down <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=39" target="_blank">free food</a>.

Checkout some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/reddragon), or follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gawruff). For anything formal, see my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/gauravmenghani) profile.

I feel reasonably confident about the spam filters these days to give out my email address here: <a href="mailto:gaurav.menghani@gmail.com">gaurav.menghani@gmail.com</a>.
