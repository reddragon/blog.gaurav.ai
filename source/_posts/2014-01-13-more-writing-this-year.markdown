It has almost been a year since I wrote something. For the most part, I have been too busy to share something. Since the past one year, I have been working on [HBase at Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UsingHbase), which is the backbone of Facebook Messages, and many other important services at Facebook. Also, I've obviously move to [Mountain View, California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California), and I absolutely love the surroundings. 

I have been trying my hand at different things, like learning some ML, Go, trying to play an Electric Guitar, and other things. One thing I want to follow this year would be to continue doing new things, and keep sharing my experiences.
