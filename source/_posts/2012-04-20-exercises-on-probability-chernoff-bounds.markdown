[Chernoff Bounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_bound) is a great tool that we learnt in [CSE638](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~bender/638/index.html). The foundation for which was laid with the great Balls-and-Bins stuff we did in [CSE548](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~bender/548/index.html).

[Here](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~sbaswana/Puzzles/Probability/exercises.html) are some exercises for Chernoff Bounds and Probability.
