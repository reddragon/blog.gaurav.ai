This is my first post on this blog, which doesn't discuss any specific problem / technology. As I have been spending time writing code, I feel its often good to sit back and introspect once in a while. It has some thoughts, which I hope will make people sit up and notice, if they are making the same mistakes. May be not enough people will read this long piece, because who cares anyway. Also, sometimes its good to be baptized by fire. But then, one day they might stumble upon this and probably these thoughts of mine will resonate with them. Probably, they will share their own wisdom with me as well. Please do :) 

In this post, I will share my views on one aspect, which I feel is at the core of my learnings from my first two years of being a full-time software engineer.

As Engineers I feel we are often excited to work on new and ambitious projects. I am specifically talking about non-trivial projects which break new ground, and/or have a reasonable change of not succeeding. The latter could be because it's often that these projects are complicated enough, that its hard to be exact with respect to the benefits, and touch certain areas of the system which are hazy.

'Hazy' doesn't really imply that that particular area / part of the system, is naturally hard to understand. It could be just that we don't know the problem well enough, and how it interacts with those 'hazy' areas. I cannot stress enough that its critical to understand the problem really well before hand. It seems clich√©d, and has been repeated so many times, that it will probably not make a good enough impact. So, I will repeat this again in detail, so it stays with you and me, a little longer.

## Understand The Problem

As per Prof. Bender, when giving a presentation, making sure that people understand why we did what we did, is the most important thing. Extending this backwards, ever wondered if that problem needs to be solved in the first place? A lot of times, as a new CS graduate, working on my first full-time unsupervised big tasks, I would really be in awe of the supposed problem. Looking with rose-tinted glasses, you feel that this is what you had told the recruiter and interviewers that you wanted to do in the job. Excellent, lets start working on it. And if you just jump into this directly, you are going to have a bad time.

Often I did not spend enough time understanding why exactly was I doing what I was doing. Do benchmarks show that this is really needed? Do I have a good enough prototype which shows that if I do what I am going to do, it will give us significant benefits? Do people need this? Has this problem been solved before? What is the minimum I can do to solve this reasonably, and move on to other bigger problems?

This proactive research is what I feel is the difference between new and experienced engineers. In fact, I think, in some cases senior engineers write LESS code than the less experienced ones and still get more things done. Its now clear to me, that the actual coding should only take 10% of the time allocated to the project. If I spend enough time doing my due-diligence and am 'lazy', I can simply prune some potential duds much before they turn into huge time sinks. If I spend some more time on the problems which actually require my time, I can figure out things I can do to reduce the scope of the problem, or cleverly use pre-built solutions to do part/most of the work. All this can only come if we (and I will repeat again) Understand. The. Problem.
