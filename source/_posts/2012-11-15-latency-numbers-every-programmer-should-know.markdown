[Here](http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers) are some latency numbers that Peter Norvig thinks every engineer should know, and I whole heartedly agree (I was recently asked questions, which required the knowledge of these numbers, and my guesstimate was quite off the mark).

Edit: [Here](https://gist.github.com/2841832) is a version with latency figures in ms, where appropriate.

Update: [Here](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html) is a version showing the change in the numbers over the years.
